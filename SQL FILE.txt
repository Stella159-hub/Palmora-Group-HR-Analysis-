  Question 11:
If the Delivery Truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method, 
and Express Air is the fastest but most expensive, do you think the company 
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.

SELECT 
    [Order_Priority], 
    [Ship_Mode], 
    COUNT([Order_ID]) AS Total_Orders,
    AVG([Shipping_Cost]) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost,
    SUM([Shipping_Cost]) AS Total_Shipping_Cost
FROM [KMS_DB].[dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study (1)]
GROUP BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode]
ORDER BY [Order_Priority], [Ship_Mode];

Based on the analysis, we found that high-priority orders mostly used Express Air,
and low-priority orders leaned toward Delivery Truck, confirming that shipping costs 
were appropriately aligned with order urgency. 
However, a few low-priority orders still used high-cost shipping,
which could be optimized further.
